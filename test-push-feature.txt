Testing the new integrated push functionality!

This file demonstrates that the Git Branch Manager now has:
- Direct push command: ./branch_manager.sh push "message"
- Interactive push interface
- All-in-one solution for branch management and GitHub integration

No need for separate push_to_github.sh script anymore!
