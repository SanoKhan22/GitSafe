# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Git branch management system that complements the existing push_to_github.sh script. The system must provide safe branch operations, automated conflict resolution, and streamlined workflows for feature development, merging, and synchronization with remote repositories.

## Glossary

- **Branch_Manager**: The main script that handles all branch operations and workflow management
- **Feature_Branch**: A development branch created for implementing specific features or fixes
- **Base_Branch**: The target branch (main, dev, or master) that feature branches are created from and merged into
- **Remote_Repository**: The GitHub repository that serves as the central source of truth
- **Working_Tree**: The current state of files in the local repository
- **Merge_Conflict**: A situation where Git cannot automatically combine changes from different branches
- **Fast_Forward_Merge**: A merge that simply moves the branch pointer forward without creating a merge commit
- **Sync_Operation**: The process of updating local branches with changes from the remote repository
- **Safe_Switch**: Branch switching that preserves uncommitted changes and prevents data loss

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create feature branches safely, so that I can work on new features without affecting the main codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL create new feature branches from the latest version of the specified base branch
2. WHEN creating a feature branch, THE Branch_Manager SHALL automatically sync the base branch with the remote repository
3. THE Branch_Manager SHALL validate that the working tree is clean before creating new branches
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL use consistent naming conventions for feature branches (feature/branch-name format)
5. WHEN a feature branch already exists, THE Branch_Manager SHALL offer to switch to it or create a new variant

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch between branches safely, so that I can work on multiple features without losing uncommitted changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL detect uncommitted changes before switching branches
2. WHEN uncommitted changes exist, THE Branch_Manager SHALL offer to stash, commit, or cancel the switch operation
3. THE Branch_Manager SHALL verify that the target branch exists before attempting to switch
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL update the working tree to match the target branch after successful switching
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL display the current branch status after each switch operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to merge feature branches automatically, so that I can integrate completed features without manual conflict resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL sync the target base branch with remote before merging
2. THE Branch_Manager SHALL attempt fast-forward merges when possible to maintain clean history
3. WHEN merge conflicts occur, THE Branch_Manager SHALL provide guided conflict resolution options
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL validate that all changes are committed before attempting merges
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL offer to delete the feature branch after successful merge

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic synchronization with remote repositories, so that I can avoid merge conflicts and work with the latest code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL fetch the latest changes from remote before any major operation
2. THE Branch_Manager SHALL detect when local branches are behind their remote counterparts
3. WHEN local branches are outdated, THE Branch_Manager SHALL offer to pull or rebase automatically
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL handle authentication issues gracefully with clear error messages
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL verify remote connectivity before attempting sync operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent conflict resolution, so that I can resolve merge conflicts efficiently with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL detect merge conflicts and categorize them by complexity
2. THE Branch_Manager SHALL offer automated resolution for simple conflicts (whitespace, formatting)
3. WHEN manual resolution is required, THE Branch_Manager SHALL launch the configured merge tool
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL validate that all conflicts are resolved before completing merges
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL provide rollback options if conflict resolution fails

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team member, I want branch workflow management, so that I can follow consistent development practices across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL support configurable workflow patterns (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, custom)
2. THE Branch_Manager SHALL enforce branch naming conventions based on the selected workflow
3. THE Branch_Manager SHALL provide branch status reporting with upstream tracking information
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL integrate with the existing push_to_github.sh script for seamless operations
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL maintain a log of all branch operations for audit and troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want interactive branch management, so that I can make informed decisions during complex operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Branch_Manager SHALL provide an interactive menu system for selecting operations
2. THE Branch_Manager SHALL display clear status information and operation previews
3. WHEN destructive operations are requested, THE Branch_Manager SHALL require explicit confirmation
4. THE Branch_Manager SHALL provide help text and usage examples for all operations
5. THE Branch_Manager SHALL support both interactive and command-line argument modes for automation
