# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for setting up a complete Flutter Android build environment on Pop!_OS (Ubuntu-based Linux distribution). The system must be capable of developing, building, and deploying Flutter applications for both web (Chrome) and Android platforms, including production-ready APK and AAB packages for Google Play Store distribution.

## Glossary

- **Flutter_SDK**: Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase
- **Android_SDK**: Software development kit that includes tools, libraries, and documentation for developing Android applications
- **JDK**: Java Development Kit required for Android development and Gradle builds
- **Gradle**: Build automation tool used by Android projects for compilation and packaging
- **APK**: Android Package file format used for distributing Android applications
- **AAB**: Android App Bundle format preferred by Google Play Store for app distribution
- **Pop_OS_System**: The target Ubuntu-based Linux distribution where the environment will be installed
- **Flutter_Doctor**: Flutter's built-in diagnostic tool that validates the development environment setup
- **Hello_World_App**: A minimal Flutter application used to verify the complete development environment

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to install all necessary system dependencies, so that I can develop Flutter applications on Pop!_OS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have Git, Curl, Unzip, Zip, and OpenJDK-17 installed through the package manager
2. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have the latest system packages updated before dependency installation
3. WHEN dependency installation completes, THE Pop_OS_System SHALL provide access to all required command-line tools
4. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL maintain Java 17 as the default JDK version for Android development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want Flutter SDK properly installed and configured, so that I can use Flutter commands and tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL be downloaded and extracted to a permanent system location
2. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have Flutter SDK path added to the system PATH environment variable
3. WHEN Flutter installation completes, THE Flutter_Doctor SHALL report Flutter SDK as properly configured
4. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL include Dart SDK as part of the installation
5. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL persist Flutter PATH configuration across system reboots

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Android developer, I want Android SDK and build tools installed, so that I can compile and package Android applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Android_SDK SHALL be installed with the latest stable API level and build tools
2. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have Android SDK path configured in environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, ANDROID_SDK_ROOT)
3. THE Android_SDK SHALL include platform-tools (ADB, Fastboot) accessible from command line
4. WHEN Android SDK installation completes, THE Flutter_Doctor SHALL report Android toolchain as ready
5. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have Android SDK license agreements accepted automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to create and run a Hello World application, so that I can verify the complete development environment works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL successfully create a new Flutter project with default template
2. THE Hello_World_App SHALL compile and run successfully in Chrome web browser
3. WHEN an Android device is connected, THE Hello_World_App SHALL install and run on the physical device
4. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL detect and list available target devices (web and Android)
5. THE Hello_World_App SHALL display the default Flutter counter application interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an Android app publisher, I want to build production-ready packages, so that I can distribute my app through Google Play Store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL generate a signed APK file from the Hello World application
2. THE Flutter_SDK SHALL generate an AAB (Android App Bundle) file suitable for Play Store upload
3. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have proper keystore generation capabilities for app signing
4. WHEN building release packages, THE Gradle SHALL complete the build process without errors
5. THE generated APK SHALL be installable on Android devices outside the development environment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want a reusable project environment, so that other developers can quickly set up the same Flutter development capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL have all environment variables properly documented and exportable
2. THE Flutter_Doctor SHALL report no issues or warnings about the development environment
3. THE Pop_OS_System SHALL maintain consistent Flutter and Android SDK versions across team members
4. WHEN environment setup completes, THE system SHALL provide a verification script to confirm all components
5. THE development environment SHALL support multiple Flutter projects without configuration conflicts
